College administrators and students will benefit from our 30 years of experience in health care related background screenings conducted by TABB INC. Our investment in technology has automated processes, reduced overhead. As a result, we are able to pass significant savings on to students and reduce the involvement of college healthcare program administrators in the screening process.
